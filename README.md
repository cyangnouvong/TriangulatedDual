# TriangulatedDual

### Project Description ###
Goals:
1. Write a program in p5.js that reads in polyhedral models and creates a triangulated dual
2. Be able to toggle between flat shading (per-polygon normals) and smooth shading (per-vertex normals)

### Keystrokes ###
1-5: Read in a mesh file (tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, star, torus)
d: Create the triangulated dual of the current mesh (you should be able to do this more than once)
n: Toggle between per-face and per-vertex normals
r: Toggle between white and randomly colored faces
space: Toggle automatic rotation on and off
